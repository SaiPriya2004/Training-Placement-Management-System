		<h3>Recruitment Process</h3>
<p >The Virtusa recruitment process consists of 4 rounds.
<li>Written Test / Online Test</li>
<li>Technical Interview</li>
<li>Group Discussion</li>
<li>HR Interview</li>
</p>
<h3>Academic Criteria</h3>
<li>65% in X, XII, and UG/PG.</li>
	<br>
	<li>There should be no backlogs at the time of the Interview.</li>
<h3>Written Test / Online Test</h3>
<p>The Virtusa online test varies in the number of questions depending on the specific profile. This segment evaluates candidates through 40-42 questions, comprising 38-40 multiple-choice questions centered on computer science fundamentals and 2 coding questions of easy to medium difficulty.
        <br>
<p>In certain cases, Virtusa may also include an aptitude round, depending on the specific profile being recruited. Additionally, for roles focused solely on software development, the Virtusa coding section can include four programming questions.</p>  
	<br> 
    <h3>Technical Interview</h3>
    <p>During this interview, expect questions covering topics from your resume, projects, fundamental SQL queries, as well as inquiries about Java, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, and any software development knowledge acquired during your bachelor's degree. Scenario-based questions can also be asked.</p>
<h3>Group Discussion</h3>
<p>Depending on the applicant pool, Virtusa may opt for a group discussion round post the technical interview, especially when dealing with a large number of applications. This approach enables the company to manage interactions more effectively, given the high volume of candidates. It's crucial for candidates to understand that a Group Discussion doesn't necessarily serve as an elimination round. Instead, interviewers use this stage to evaluate communication skills, persuasive abilities, leadership qualities, and the capacity to work collaboratively within a team.</p>
<h3>HR Round</h3>
<p>In this round, you will be asked general questions like:</p>
<p>1.Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?</p>
<p>2.Would you like to work overtime or odd hours?</p>
<p>3.Why are you interested in this job?</p>
<p>4.What are your strengths?</p>
<p>And Many more questions.........</p>
