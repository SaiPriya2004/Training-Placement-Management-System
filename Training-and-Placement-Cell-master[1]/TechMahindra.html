<p>The first round in the Tech Mahindra Recruitment Process is a written test to evaluate a candidate's Aptitude and Technical skills. It consists of the following three sections:</p>
<li>Aptitude</li>
<li>Essay Writing in English</li>
<li>Technical Test</li>
<h3>Psychometric Test (optional)</h3>
<p>In the Tech Mahindra interview process, a Psychometric Test is taken for the candidates who clear Round one. This round is a personality psychometric that is used to assess work behaviour. This round is a non-elimination round in which there is a written test (now online) with around eighty questions for the candidates to solve in about 20/30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Technical Written Test</h3>
<p>The students who clear the second written round are called for an interview. In this round, they generally ask you to optimize the codes you did in the second written round. You may also be asked questions about data structures, algorithms, and SQL. You may also be asked puzzles in this round.</p>
<h3>Technical interviews</h3>
<p>This round will likely include questions about any part of the candidate's study. To pass this level, you must have a strong understanding of computer science fundamentals. A candidate should be familiar with data structures, algorithms, database management systems, operating systems, networking, object-oriented programming concepts, and their preferred programming language (e.g., C++, Java, Python). Candidates from branches other than computer science should study topics relevant to their profession.</p>
<p>During the interview, Computer Science candidates will be tested on their coding skills. The panel will also ask questions about your résumé, so be sure you know what you've included on your CV. This round may also include puzzle-related questions.</p>
